# Hi, I'm Denalia 👋🏻

```
A long-time dabbler in design and programming
one day decided, "I'll (git) commit to the bit."
```
### I'm learning web development
`👩🏻‍💻`  Following "Full Stack Javascript" with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
<br>`🔨`  Making silly things to practice serious concepts
<br>`🐸` Like this React app → [<kbd>  Froget-Me-Not  </kbd>](https://github.com/denaliazhi/forget-me-not?tab=readme-ov-file#froget-me-not). Go on. Give it a play.
