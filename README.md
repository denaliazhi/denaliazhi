# Hi, I'm Denalia 👋🏻

```
A data analyst who dabbled in design and programming,
one day decided, "I'll (git) commit to the bit."
```
#### 🔨 I went from zero to full-stack with [The Odin Project](https://denalia.dev/the-odin-project)
Made silly things to practice serious concepts like [<kbd>  Tic Tac Toe  </kbd>](https://github.com/denaliazhi/tic-tac-toe?tab=readme-ov-file#tic-tac-toe) (with a punny twist) and [<kbd>  Froget-Me-Not  </kbd>](https://github.com/denaliazhi/forget-me-not?tab=readme-ov-file#froget-me-not).

#### 👩‍💻 Currently, learning WordPress and freelancing as a web designer
